# Loss Weighting Ablation Configurations
# Test different temporal weightings for long-horizon performance

description: "Loss weighting ablation study"

# Uniform loss (baseline)
uniform:
  type: uniform
  description: "Uniform loss on [0,T]"
  weight_fn: "1.0"

# Linear increasing weight (emphasize late time)
linear_increasing:
  type: linear
  start_weight: 0.5
  end_weight: 1.5
  description: "Linearly increasing weight (0.5 -> 1.5)"
  weight_fn: "0.5 + t/T"

# Exponential increasing
exp_increasing:
  type: exponential
  base_weight: 0.5
  growth_rate: 1.0
  description: "Exponentially increasing weight"
  weight_fn: "0.5 * exp(t/T)"

# Two-stage: uniform then late-focus
two_stage:
  type: two_stage
  stage1_epochs: 50
  stage1_weights: uniform
  stage2_epochs: 50
  stage2_weights: late_focus
  late_focus_start: 0.5  # Focus on t > 0.5*T
  description: "Two-stage: uniform then late-time focus"

# Window-based (segments)
segment:
  type: segment
  n_segments: 4
  weights: [0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5]
  description: "Segment-based weights (4 segments)"

# Expected outcomes:
# - uniform: good baseline
# - linear_increasing: may help long-horizon drift
# - two_stage: often best for long trajectories
