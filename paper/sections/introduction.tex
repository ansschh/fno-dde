% Introduction

Delay differential equations (DDEs) arise naturally in many scientific and engineering domains
where the rate of change of a system depends not only on its current state but also on its past
states. Applications include population dynamics, control systems with communication delays,
epidemiology, and neuroscience.

The initial value problem for a DDE defines an operator
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{G}: (\phi, \theta) \mapsto x(\cdot) \text{ on } [0,T],
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the history function on $[-\tau_{\max}, 0]$, $\theta$ are parameters (rates,
delays, etc.), and the output is the trajectory $x(t)$ for $t \in [0,T]$.

This ``history-to-future function'' structure is exactly what neural operators are designed for.
In this work, we explore whether Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)---originally developed for
parametric partial differential equations---can effectively learn the solution operator for
families of DDEs.

Our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A benchmark suite of five DDE families spanning discrete and distributed delays,
  \item A dataset generation pipeline with careful treatment of history functions and solver accuracy,
  \item Baseline FNO experiments demonstrating the feasibility of operator learning for DDEs.
\end{itemize}
